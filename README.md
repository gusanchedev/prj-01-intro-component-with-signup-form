## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- TailwindCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- DOM manipulation with Javascript


### What I learned

I use tailwind classes to change styles  but also Javascript. The border color was not modified natively in Tailwindcss so I decided change it from Javascript.

How to validate email with Javscript regex:

```js
const emailRegex = /^\D.*@\D*\w*\.\w*/;
//...
if (!emailInput.value || !emailRegex.test(emailInput.value)) {
    exclamationMail.classList.replace("invisible", "visible");
    errorMail.classList.replace("invisible", "visible");
    emailContainer.style.borderColor = "hsl(0, 100%, 74%)";
    emailInput.style.color = "hsl(0, 100%, 74%)";
```

How to validate data once submit button is pressed
```js
button.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  validateFields();     //call the function
});
```

### Continued development

Future projects will be developed using TailwindCSS and Javascript when interactivity must be included.

### Useful resources
